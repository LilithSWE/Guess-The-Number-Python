# Guess The Number

## Description

This is my first Git published python project. I made a simple guess the number game which randmizes a number between 1 and 10 whenever the program starts.
It accepts the players name and guesses. If the guess is anything but a digit between 1 and 10, the player will be asked to try again.
Once the player has guessed the correct number the game ends.

## Tech

Python

## Lessons

I learned a few different things in python during this short project:

- "Import random" and how to limit it to the right span.
- Defining variables.
- Accepting input from the user and storing it in a variable.
- Error manage the input from the user.
- While loops.
- If statements.
- How to call, and print, a variable in text to the user using the ".format()" function.

## How to run the program

Download the repo and run the program in the terminal from the main.py file.
Then to play the game, simply follow the instructions in the terminal.
